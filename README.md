# ableton-mcp-v1

> **A V1-focused fork of Ableton MCP**, with reliability-oriented tools for AI-assisted music creation in Ableton Live.
>
> **Credit / lineage:** Ableton MCP was originally created by **Siddharth Ahuja** — [ahujasid/ableton-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/ableton-mcp) (MIT). That's where it started. This fork is built directly on the expanded 2.0.0 build at [jpoindexter/ableton-mcp](https://github.com/jpoindexter/ableton-mcp) (vendored at commit `fa4f9ec`), which itself derives from Ahuja's original.
>
> It tracks upstream and adds atomic clip writing, drum-pad mapping, bulk session snapshots, structured result objects, honest export-capability reporting, and file-based audio import. The fork is **additive** — no upstream tool is removed or renamed. See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for the full list of fork-only changes and attribution.

# AbletonMCP - Ableton Live Model Context Protocol Integration

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@ahujasid/ableton-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@ahujasid/ableton-mcp)

AbletonMCP connects Ableton Live to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Ableton Live. This integration enables AI-assisted music production, track creation, and Live session manipulation.

**200+ tools** for near-complete Ableton Live Object Model (LOM) coverage including AI-powered music generation.

## Three Ways to Use AbletonMCP

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify AbletonMCP is selected in Ableton's Control Surface settings
- Check that no other application is using port 9877
- Restart both Claude and Ableton Live

### Timeout Errors
- Break complex requests into smaller steps
- Allow time for Ableton to process commands

### Script Not Loading
- Ensure the `__init__.py` file is in a folder named exactly `AbletonMCP`
- Check Ableton's Log.txt for errors

### Commands Not Working
- Make sure you're requesting actions on valid track/clip indices
- Check that clips exist before trying to edit notes
- Verify devices are loaded before adjusting parameters

## Technical Details

### Communication Protocol

JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets (port 9877):

```json
// Request
{"type": "command_name", "params": { ... }}

// Response
{"status": "success", "result": { ... }}
